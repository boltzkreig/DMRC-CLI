# DMRC-CLI

A convenient CLI frontend for the DMRC website — with some much-needed addenda.

---

## Features

* Get journey details from one station to another.
* Query journeys with *minimum interchanges* (defaulting to *least distance*, as on the official website).
* Display station details and available amenities.
* Fetch first and last train timings for your route.
* **Extra:** The official website sometimes doesn’t recommend your desired route — use the `via` option to ensure your intended journey is estimated.
* **Extra:** Find the 5 closest stations (with bearing) using [Termux-API](https://github.com/termux/termux-api).

---

## Installation

Navigate to your desired location ($HOME/.config), then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/boltzkreig/DMRC-CLI.git
cd DMRC
python3 entry.py bootstrap
```

Then, add the recommended path as an alias for convenience.

## Usage

Use the `--help` flag to learn more.
Some examples:

1. Interactive origin-to-destination query:

2. Non-interactive query:

   DMRC -f origin -d destination
   ```

3. Use a via station:

   ```bash
   DMRC -v [VIA]
   ```

4. Get station details:
